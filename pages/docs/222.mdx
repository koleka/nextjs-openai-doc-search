I. Introduction

Explanation of common issues with wavy hair: lack of definition and "poofiness"
Introduction to the concept of hair clumping for better wave definition
II. Definition of Clumping

Explaining what clumping is: when strands of hair work together to form one wave or curl instead of independent curls
III. Method for Achieving Clumped Waves

Introduction to "squish to condish" method
Step 1: Cleanse and condition hair
Step 2: Squish in additional conditioner while upside down, striving for the perfect water-to-conditioner ratio
Step 3: Apply a product like gel to keep clumps together for better wave definition
Step 4: Allow hair to dry; using a diffuser to speed up the process if necessary, while being careful not to break up clumps
Step 5: Scrunch out any cast left on hair to reveal soft, defined waves
IV. Recommendations for Maintaining Clumped Waves

Avoid brushing hair when dry, instead use a wide-toothed comb while using conditioner
Don't use a comb while squishing
Avoid manipulating hair while it's drying to minimize frizz and maximize clumps
V. Conclusion

Emphasis on careful and proper hair care for achieving better wave definition through clumping
